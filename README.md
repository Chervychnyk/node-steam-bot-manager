# NodeJS Bot Management Tool
A bot management tool for Steam Community (www.steamcommunity.com) which runs using NodeJS.



# CAUTION:
#### I do not recommend running any bots in production mode, as there are possibly many caveats I have not yet discovered. Until further notice, I recommend only trying out the functionality and reporting any problems you encounter.

## Demo:
TODO: None available yet.

## Features:
- Talk to people on the Bot's friends list
- Trade with people on the Bot's friends list.
- Set-up 2-factor-authentication (including the phone-number if not yet on account)
- Handle API sign-up process (ez, ik)
- Run multiple bot at once
- Calculate the inventory worth (relative to Steam Market prices) using another system I am currently working on.

## Set-up:
